EmotionML provides mechanisms to represent emotions in terms of scientifically valid descriptors: categories, dimensions, appraisals, and action tendencies. Given the lack of agreement in the community, EmotionML does not provide a single vocabulary of emotion terms, but gives users a choice to select the most suitable emotion vocabulary in their annotations. In order to promote interoperability, publicly defined vocabularies should be used where possible and reasonable from the point of view of the target application. The present document provides a number of emotion vocabularies that can be used for this purpose.Status of this documentThis section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication. Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found in the W3C technical reports index at http://www.w3.org/TR/.This is the 1 April 2014 W3C Working Group Note of "Vocabularies for EmotionML".This document represents an important complement to the Emotion Markup Language specification [EmotionML], i.e., a public collection of emotion vocabularies that can be used with EmotionML. It was originally part of an earlier draft of the EmotionML specification, but was moved out of it because of the quasi-static nature of Recommendation Track documents. Publishing the vocabularies as a separate document allows us to provide updates, extensions and corrections of the list of vocabularies as required, without having to follow the multiple steps involved in releasing a new version of a Recommendation.The present document serves as a repository of emotion vocabularies in both human-readable and machine-readable form. Even though its first version was published as a Working Draft, the document status has been changed to W3C Working Group Note to allow for occasional updates without raising the expectation of progressing towards a normative Recommendation. Since the work described here reflects an evolving state of the art on Emotion vocabularies, the Working Group believes it is premature to propose a normative Recommendation on Vocabularies at this time.The main differences from the previous version are:adding the version information in the computer-readable definition of emotion vocabularieschanging the file extension of the computer-readable definition of emotion vocabularies from ".xml" to ".emotionml" based on the definition in the EmotionML specificationThe following editorial changes are also made:updating the reference to the EmotionML specification with its Proposed Recommendation in Section 6.1updating the link to Ekman's "Universals and Cultural Differences in Facial Expressions of Emotion" in Section 6.2Any future updates to this Note will respect the repository-type nature of this document, as described in Section 1.1.This W3C Working Group Note has been developed by the Multimodal Interaction Working Group of the W3C Multimodal Interaction Activity. It represents consensus in the group's EmotionML subgroup. The group is likely to produce new versions of this document, but will strive to maintain syntactic compatibility with the current version. In particular the XML identifiers of vocabularies and the items in each vocabulary can be expected to remain valid with future versions of this Note. It is expected that any updates to this document will mostly add new vocabularies, or add explanations to existing vocabularies and/or vocabulary items.Comments for this note are welcomed and should have a subject starting with the prefix '[emotion-voc]'. Please send them to www-multimodal@w3.org, the public email list for issues related to Multimodal. This list is archived and acceptance of this archiving policy is requested automatically upon first post. To subscribe to this list send an email to www-multimodal-request@w3.org with the word "subscribe" in the subject line.Publication as a Working Group Note does not imply endorsement by the W3C Membership. This is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to cite this document as other than work in progress.This document was produced by a group operating under the 5 February 2004 W3C Patent Policy. W3C maintains a public list of any patent disclosures made in connection with the deliverables of the group; that page also includes instructions for disclosing a patent. An individual who has actual knowledge of a patent which the individual believes contains Essential Claim(s) must disclose the information in accordance with section 6 of the W3C Patent Policy.Table of Contents1 Introduction1.1 Repository nature of this document1.2 Use of undated URIs to refer to vocabularies in this document2 Emotion category vocabularies2.1 Ekman's "big six" basic emotions2.2 Everyday emotion vocabulary2.3 OCC categories2.4 FSRE categories2.5 Frijda's categories3 Emotion dimension vocabularies3.1 Mehrabian's PAD dimensions3.2 FSRE dimensions3.3 The intensity dimension4 Appraisal vocabularies4.1 OCC appraisals4.2 Scherer's appraisals4.3 EMA appraisals5 Action tendency vocabularies5.1 Frijda's action tendencies6 References6.1 Technical references6.2 Scientific references1 IntroductionThis document provides a list of emotion vocabularies that can be used with EmotionML to represent emotions and related states. EmotionML provides mechanisms to represent emotions in terms of scientifically valid descriptors: categories, dimensions, appraisals, and action tendencies. Given the lack of agreement in the community, EmotionML does not provide a single vocabulary of emotion terms, but gives users a choice to select the most suitable emotion vocabulary in their annotations. In order to promote interoperability, publicly defined vocabularies should be used where possible and reasonable from the point of view of the target application. The present document provides a number of emotion vocabularies that can be used for this purpose.The guiding principle for selecting emotion vocabularies for inclusion in this document has been to list vocabularies that are either:commonly used in technological contexts, orrepresent current emotion models from the scientific literature.In addition, given the difficulty to define mappings between emotion categories, dimensions, appraisals and action tendencies, we have included pairs or groups of vocabularies where these mappings are rather well defined. Future versions of EmotionML can use these vocabularies as a starting point to define mappings between different emotion descriptions.The selection of emotion vocabularies in this document is necessarily incomplete; users are likely to find emotion vocabularies to be missing. There are two ways how a user can address this situation. First, users can easily write a definition for a custom emotion vocabulary as described in the EmotionML specification's section on Defining vocabularies. Secondly, feedback on the selection of emotion vocabularies in this document is highly appreciated. Future versions of this document can include corrections and more thorough explanations for the existing vocabularies, and add additional vocabularies which may be of interest to a wider audience. Please send comments to www-multimodal@w3.org (with public archive).1.1 Repository nature of this documentThe present document serves as a repository of emotion vocabularies in both human-readable and machine-readable form. Any future updates to this Note will respect the repository-type nature of this document, by maintaining backward-compatibility as follows:all future updates will retain all existing names of vocabularies and of existing vocabulary items;new vocabularies may added under new names, and new items may be added to existing vocabularies;new metadata may be added to vocabularies and items, in order to specify in more detail the intended meaning and properties of the vocabularies and items as defined in the present documents and in the original literature from which the vocabularies were extracted.Should any corrections to existing vocabularies be required which would break the above-mentioned backward-compatibility rules, the corrected vocabulary will be published under a new name alongside the original, uncorrected vocabulary.1.2 Use of undated URIs to refer to vocabularies in this documentGiven the repository nature of the document, references to the vocabularies should use the undated "Latest Version" URI of this document to refer to emotion vocabularies, as shown in the examples below, and not the dated "This Version" URI. This promotes interoperability. Furthermore, it makes it possible for older documents to automatically benefit from updates to the repository, such as new metadata being added to existing vocabularies. Since documents always refer to the latest, compatible version of a vocabulary via the "Latest Version" URI, it becomes possible to process older documents in terms of the newest metadata without having to update the documents.2 Emotion category vocabulariesThis section provides vocabularies for use with the EmotionML <category> element.2.1 Ekman's "big six" basic emotionsThese six terms are proposed by Paul Ekman (Ekman, 1972, p. 251-252) as basic emotions with universal facial expressions -- emotions that are recognized and produced in all human cultures.TermRemarksangerdisgustfearhappinesssadnesssurpriseThe computer-readable definition of this vocabulary can be used in EmotionML as indicated in the following example.<emotion category-set="http://www.w3.org/TR/emotion-voc/xml#big6">

</emotion>2.5 Frijda's categoriesThis category set is included because according to Nico Frijda's proposal of action tendencies (Frijda, 1986), these categories are related to action tendencies. See Frijda's action tendencies, below.TermRemarksangerrelated to action tendency 'agonistic'arrogancerelated to action tendency 'approach'desirerelated to action tendency 'approach'disgustrelated to action tendency 'rejecting'enjoymentrelated to action tendency 'being-with'fearrelated to action tendency 'avoidance'humilityrelated to action tendency 'submitting'indifferencerelated to action tendency 'nonattending'interestrelated to action tendency 'attending'resignationrelated to action tendency 'submitting'shockrelated to action tendency 'interrupting'surpriserelated to action tendency 'interrupting'The computer-readable definition of this vocabulary can be used in EmotionML as indicated in the following example.<emotion category-set="http://www.w3.org/TR/emotion-voc/xml#frijda-categories">

    <dimension name="valence" value="0.5"/>
</emotion>3.3 The intensity dimensionSometimes it is necessary to represent the mere fact that an emotion of some undefined nature is present with a certain intensity. This can be achieved using the dimension vocabulary consisting of the single dimension "intensity".TermRemarksintensitythe intensity of the (unidentified) emotion that is considered to be presentThe computer-readable definition of this vocabulary can be used in EmotionML as indicated in the following example.<emotion dimension-set="http://www.w3.org/TR/emotion-voc/xml#intensity-dimension">
